# Introduction to Self-Engineering Module 3
##  Understanding the Identity Trap 
40 minute module

**Instructional Objectives**
1. Students will understand that power of habits for transforming identity. 
2. Students will learn the six core drivers to shifting in one's identity and outcomes.
3. Students will collaborate and create a list of positive behaviors and habits that can lead to success as a software engineering learner and software engineer in the field.

### Opener 
In this module, we consider the concept of self identity as well as a few models to use in practice, to shift in one's identity into that of a successful learner and (eventual) software engineer in the industry. 

### Can You Change Your Self-Identity?
(7 min)
_excerpts from James Clear_

You can force yourself into going to the gym or eating healthy every once in a while, but unless you attempt to shift your underlying identity, it will be hard to stick with the long-term changes. **There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.**

**Your identity emerges out of your habits.** Every belief that you have including those you feel about yourself, are learned and conditioned through experience and learning over time.

Your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.

**The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior.** In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words **essentitas**, which means being, and, **identidem**, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your **“repeated beingness.”**

**Habits are the path to changing your identity.** The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

- Each time you write a page, you are a writer.
- Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.
- Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.
- Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.

Each habit gets results and teaches you something far more important: **to trust yourself.** You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.

### Collaborative Brainstorm
(10 min)
We know that our habits are the largest contributor to forming our identities now. Let's use this time to create a list of habits that can lead to your success as a software engineer as well as success as a learner.

Comment the positive habits you feel apply in the chat, and we will develop a master list for the cohort moving forward.

**- Positive Software-Engineer Habits**
 
**- Positive Learner Habits**
