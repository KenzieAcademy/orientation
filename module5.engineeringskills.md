**Instructional Objectives**
1. Students will read the Engineering Skills content in MyKenzie.
2. Students will review the Engineering Skills for comprehension.
3. Students will participate in activities to clear up preconceived notions about their understanding of engineering skills.

### Opener 
In this module, students compile their knowledge of the Engineering Skills from the MyKenzie course content.

### Review Engineering Skills 
(7 min)

**Engineering Skills Module are housed in Hello, Kenzie!**

We have identified **7 skills** that we believe to be critical to your success as a software engineer. These skills will be introduced, practiced, and reinforced throughout the course. As we progress through the course, we will provide you with strategies to apply these skills toward achieving your learning outcomes.
