# Introduction to Self-Engineering Module 2
## Growth Mindset 
55 minute module

**Instructional Objectives**
1. Students will differentiate fixed and growth mindset. 
2. Students will apply growth mindset to metacognitive thinking and "self talk".
3. Students will build their growth mindset vocabulary.

### Opener 
In this module, we build upon our knowledge of metacognition by gaining understanding for the concept of growth mindset. In the metacognition module, we defined our human super powers as self awareness and reflection. This means we have enhanced abilities as humans to attend to our thinking, powerful for learning. Growth mindset is a similar, powerful tool for learning. In this module, we will demonstrate growth mindset in comparison to a fixed mindset. We will discuss the relation of growth mindset to metacognitive skill and learning success.

**Debrief**

**> Part 1 - Intelligence**

Most people lean toward a particular mindset, however concerning intelligence. You can also substitute “artistic talent” or “business skill” in place of intelligence. Statements 1 and 2 are fixed mindset; statements 3 and 4 are growth mindset. 
> 
**> Part 2 - Personal Qualities**
> With which statements did you agree most? Did you notice any that your responses to the "character" statements differed from your "intelligence" statements? Statements 1 and 3 are fixed mindset; statements 2 and 4 are growth mindset.

**Debrief and Definition**
(2 min)
> Fixed Mindset individuals believe that their abilities, skills, intelligence, ability to learn, personality and more are pretty much carved in stone and cannot be changed.

### Negative Self-Talk and Limiting Beliefs
(8 min)

One way that we can identify the truth about our mindsets is to pay attention to our "self-talk", or the ways in which we speak to ourselves. Have you ever noticed yourself saying things like, "I can't do math"; "I will never be able to jump that high"; or "My brain just does not work in that way!" ? 

These types of statements represent certain limiting beliefs and thoughts that we have concerning our capabilities, which manifest in our speech and reflects a fixed mindset. It might be rather sneaky to catch them at times; however, you should take inventory of your words and thoughts using metacognitive skill; here you can catch limiting beliefs in the act and begin to re-word and re-program your thoughts toward growth mindset. Your actions will follow and also become more productive. 

#### Limiting Belief

**I can never focus myself long enough to finish this!**

#### Revised Belief

**This might take some time and strategies, but I can train my mind to focus until I finish this thing.** 

#### Activity
Look at the sheet picture below with the following questions. Jot down your answers on paper or electronically.
1. What negative messages do I give to myself in regards to learning?
2. What messages might I say in place of negative self talk? What might I tell myself instead, in regards to learning?

### Growth Mindset Vocabulary
(7 min)
Below is a grid of words that apply directly to the idea of growth mindset, problem solving and metacognitive thinking. Each of these is tied to meaning in regards to learning. Take a look at the grid and decide which words you will adopt into your growth mindset repository. Remember, words that may "appear" negative can be repurposed to have a growth meaning. 

Take a picture or screenshot of this grid if you would like. Borrow four of the 12 words for your vocabulary. Jot down on paper or electronically, for the next 5 minutes, how these will contribute to your working growth mindset vocabulary.
