# Introduction to Self-Engineering Module 7
## Learning to Learn
55 minute module

**Instructional Objectives**
1. Students will understand how the brain works, capturing sensory input into working memory and how this precedes learning.
2. Students will review ideas for strengthening brain memory and focus including environmental control and reducing decision fatigue.
3. Students will understand various learning preferences, to begin identifying the modalities that work best for them, and review best practices for learning such as collaboration and practice. 

### Opener 
To build upon what we know about external self-awareness and mindset, in this module we review how the brain works as a neural network to support learning. With this understanding, we can speak to specific strategies to increase effectiveness as a student learner as well as reduce distractions and increase focus for learning.

### Memory: The Human Brain

**Make Meaning: Making new connections to information you already understand.**

**What is the Purpose of this Video to learning?**
The Magic number 7 (plus or minus two) provides evidence for the capacity of short term memory. Most adults can store between 5 and 9 items in their short-term memory.  

Short term memory seems to be between 15 and 30 seconds. Items can be kept in short term memory by **repeating** verbally, or through practice, a process known as **rehearsal.** This is working memory.

Working memory is important for reasoning, learning and comprehension. The longer information stays in working memory, the more likely it will become encoded in long-term. Practice! 

### Your Environment and Decision Fatigue

#### Have a Space Just for Learning.

> Predictable. Instead of focusing on square footage and actual space, think about creating consistency. You can dedicate a corner of a room, but you can also create learning spaces that are more flexible. For example, pull out the same foldable chairs and tables when it is time to learn.

#### Create a Comfortable Space/ De-Clutter 

> After designating a space for learning, focus on removing distractions. Remember, less is more. Too many books, supplies, etc. can crowd a space and create a feeling of chaos. 
> Create an orderly environment by decluttering the area; make it visual but not cognitively cluttered.  

#### Make It Visual, but not too visual  

> Look for ways to create inspiring, creative, and visual places for your mind to wander. - Hang small pictures, posters, family photos, and other things that create a positive place to feel inspired, safe, and free. Be sure to keep things simple and purposeful, and avoid hanging up too many distractions. 

#### Organize a Well-Lit Area.

Believe it or not, lighting is an important factor in effective learning spaces. Lighting can affect energy, attention, and achievement levels. If you do not have windows or good lighting in the space where you are learning, you can use mirrors! Place a mirror across from a window to reflect more of the natural light into the room.

### Learning Preferences and Methods

- Verbal (prefers words)
- Logical (prefers math and logical problem solving)
- Visual (prefers images and spatial relationships)
- Kinesthetic (prefers body movements and doing)
- Rhythmic (prefers music, rhymes)
- Interpersonal (prefers group work)
- Intrapersonal (prefers introspection and independence)
- Naturalist (prefers nature, natural categories) 

Most can learn through any of the following, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have preferences (as we all do) to make instruction more meaningful and engaging.

**VARK approach (Visual, Aural, Reading/Writing, and Kinesthetic):**
> Visual learners prefer images, charts, and the like. Aural learners learn better by listening. Reading/writing learners learn better through written language. Kinesthetic learners learn through doing, practicing, and acting.

### Collaborate + Study In Groups
**Social drive in learning can take you further than you can go alone.** 
- encourages discussion and thinking about ideas you might not have considered. You can learn more than they would if working individually.
- Understand each other’s perspectives and structure projects to require shared learning and co-creating. True collaboration involves the listening and recognizing how ideas can be combined. 
- Take on well-defined roles—like facilitator, recorder, or presenter—to make sure that group members know how to contribute effectively.
- Students can work together by **teaching each other.** Preparing to teach is a powerful way to engage the social brain; teaching others often benefits the tutor the most.

### Practice, Practice, Practice +

What research does show is  that deliberate practice is the most important element in developing expertise that is within a person’s control.

“Practice puts brains in our muscles.” (Sam Snead)
